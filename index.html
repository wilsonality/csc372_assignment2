            <h1>Why Travel?</h1>
            <p class="green">Traveling is the my soul's way of communicating with the world.
                My love for this planet is expressed through witnessing it in 
                all of its glory, one viewpoint at a time. I know that not all 
                are able to travel to the extent that I do, so I document my 
                excursions here for all to see. Come with me as I travel the world, 
                and stay tuned for the advice and wisdom that I learn along the way. 
            </p>
            <p>Stay curious!</p>
