                <!-- Overview -->
            <p> Nepal in the summer time is beautiful.
                I stayed in a hostel near Kathmandu, the capital of the nation. <br>
                Kathmandu is a beautiful city with an ancient history.

                <li>Swaymbhunath - The Monkey Temple
                    <p>Swaymbhunath is an ancient religious structure in Kathmandu Valley,
                        dating back to at least the third century BCE. It's a pilgrimage
                        site for Buddhists around the world, and has thousands of visitors
                        every year, both Buddhists and Hindus.

                        It is also known as the monkey temple, for the population of monkeys
                        at the site.

                    Street Food
                    <p>Nepal has a wide range of street food to offer!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloo_chap">Aloo Chop</a> - fried potato patties
                        </li>
                        <li>

                <li>Backpacking
                    <p>Nepal is friendly to backpackers looking to get immersed in the culture without
                        staying off their feet for too long. The many temples, mountainous treks, and 
                        ancient cities offer an array of on-foot experiences. I seriously recommended 
                         adding nepal to your backpacking bucket list.

            <h2>Wilson's Tips: Local Eats, Spots, Sights</h2>
            <p>As a renowned traveler, I cannot let you visit Nepal without
                telling you the must-tries, must-sees, and must-eats.
                My trip would not have been the same without these things.

            <ul class="earth">
                
                <li>The Himalayas
                    <p>I mean, it's pretty hard to not-see them! The mountain ranges are truly stunning.
                         Even if you don't want to the (very) treacherous hike up the slope, there
                        flights that fly along the mountains.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Daal Bat
                    <p>This is the national dish of Nepal! It's a hearty dish that earns its title with the first bite.
                        <em>Daal</em> is a flavorful lentil soup that is served with white rice and side dishes.
                        It can be vegan friendly, and should be tried no matter your palate.
                    </p>

                <li>Naranyanhiti Palace
                    <div class="splitbox">
                        <p>Naranyanhiti Palace is a historical site integral to Nepali history.
                            It was home to the monarchs of Nepal before the Royal Massacre in 2001.
                            In the years that followed, the palace was turned into a museum, with
                             the crown jewels on display.

                <li>Everest South Base Camp
                    <p>It's big, it's famous, it's Everest! This is the base camp in Nepal;
                        there is another in Tibet, the autonomous state in China. Fun Fact:
                        the wind up there can reach up to 200 mph!
